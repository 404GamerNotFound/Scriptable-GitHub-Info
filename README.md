# Scriptable GitHub Info
 The Scriptable script creates a dynamic iOS widget that interacts with the GitHub API to fetch and display information about a specified user's repositories directly on your home screen. Depending on the widget's size — small, medium, or large — it will show the latest 2, 3, or 6 repositories, respectively, from the user's GitHub profile. For each repository, it presents key details such as the repository name, description, programming language used, the number of stars, and forks. The widget background and text colors are customized for clarity and aesthetic appeal, and the script includes error handling for cases where no repositories are found or the user's profile does not exist. The widget updates periodically to reflect the most current data from GitHub, ensuring the displayed information is up to date.
